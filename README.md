# Linux Virtual Lab Setup

## Description
This repository contains a complete guide for setting up a **Linux virtual lab** on a personal computer using **Oracle VirtualBox**.  
The lab allows students, developers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts to safely run Linux virtual machines (VMs) for hands-on practice, networking experiments, and penetration testing exercises.  
It includes instructions for both pre-built VM images (e.g., CSE-LABVM, Kali Linux) and ISO-based manual installations. The lab environment provides a secure and isolated platform, ensuring that all experiments do not affect the host operating system.



## Overview
This lab allows users to prepare a host computer for virtualization, install VirtualBox and Extension Pack, import Linux VMs, and use them effectively for various exercises.



## Objectives
1. Prepare a host computer for virtualization.
2. Install VirtualBox and Extension Pack.
3. Import Linux virtual machines into VirtualBox.
4. Familiarize with Linux VM environment and tools.



## Required Resources
- PC with at least 4 GB RAM and 50 GB free disk space.
- High-speed internet for downloading VirtualBox and VM images (~5 GB).
- Oracle VirtualBox and Extension Pack installed.
- 64-bit host system with virtualization enabled in BIOS.
